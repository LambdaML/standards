# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the difference between something being a Standard and
   something that is simply recommended, or that just happens to be
   used by people at Gilt?

Our intent with the standards is to define technical standards. From wikipediea:

    A technical standard is an established norm or requirement in
    regard to technical systems. It is usually a formal document that
    establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods,
    processes and practices.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard

Our expectation is that we will all follow the standards. If we find
that a standard is not useful or has become an obstacle; we change the
standard. The emphasis on defining standards is to really be careful,
recommending the basic standards we need at gilt to be productive
without being prescriptive about details that actually don't improve
cross team collaboration.

In the documentation, items identified as "Gilt Standards" are
intended to be requirements for all of us. Best practices,
recommendations from other teams, etc. may be highlighted in the
standards documentation as "General Suggestions."

An example:

    We have adopted [REST over
    HTTP/JSON](https://github.com/gilt/standards-rest) as the standard
    method for communication between services. We thus expect that all
    new services will be RESTful. Tools like www.apidoc.me, while used
    by a number of teams, are simply tools. We know that tools come
    and go and that individual preferences vary widely. So if the
    tooling is helpful, by all means take advantage! Or introduce
    better tooling for REST APIs. Ultimately the standard is REST; the
    implementation details are left to individual teams.
