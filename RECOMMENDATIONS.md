# Technology recommendations at Gilt

This is our shared assessment of the various technologies
currently used at Gilt or potentially useful to Gilt.

See [README](README.md) for a general discussion about the
differences between RECOMMENDATIONS and STANDARDS.

Techologies listed here are tagged with one of **Adopt**, **Trial**, **Assess**, **Hold**, in the spirit of
[Thoughtworks technology radar](http://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/faq)


- **Adopt**: We feel strongly that the we should be using these
  technologies. Use them when appropriate on your projects.

- **Trial**: Worth pursuing. It is important to understand how to
  build up this capability. There is still a lot of risk as the
  technology is not yet fully supported by teams at Gilt.

- **Assess**: Worth exploring with the goal of understanding how it will
  fit at Gilt - does it solve a new problem or improve an existing one?

- **Hold**: Proceed with caution - generally speaking technologies in hold
  at Gilt have failed in some way and should not be used on new projects.


Depending on your personal attitude and the needs of your project you can either stick to
a stack of *adopt*ed technologies or experiment. Probably a good idea to reduce our
footprint of on *hold* technologies over time.

If you feel that something is not listed here but should be - submit a pull request.
