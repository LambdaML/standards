# Source Code Management

## Adopt

  - GitHub
  Public repositories for all open source work and private repositories for internal projects.

## Hold

  - Gerrit
  Gerrit is only suitable for internal projects with private repositories. All new repositories should be created in GitHub. GitHub seems to have more momentum at the moment and we don't want to grow our Gerrit infrastructure.
