# Web

## Adopt

  - [Play](https://www.playframework.com/)

## Assess

  - [Akka HTTP](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.11/scala/http/)
    We think that for writing lean microservices without a web
    frontend Akka HTTP offers an interesting approach without all the
    (mostly not needed) bagagge that Play brings. Its integration with
    Akka Stream and Akka Actors makes it the perfect fit for writing
    reactive, high-concurrent and resilient services.

## Hold

  - commons-service-core
